    <h2>Vaccines</h2>
    <p>
        There are 4 types of vaccines: 
        <ul>
        <li>Whole Virus Vaccine</li>
        <li>RNA or mRNA Vaccine</li>
        <li>Non-Replicating Viral Vector</li>
        <li>Protein Subunit</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>1. Whole Virus Vaccine</h3>
    <p><b>Vaccines include:</b> Sinopharm, Sinovac</p>
    <p>Number of doses required: 2 doses, intramuscular</p>
    <p><b>What to know:</b> The whole virus vaccine uses a weakened or deactivated form of the pathogen that causes COVID-19 to trigger protective immunity to it. The two vaccines mentioned above – Sinopharm and Sinovac – both use inactivated pathogens, therefore they cannot infect cells and replicate, but can trigger an immune response.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>2. RNA or mRNA Vaccine</h3>
    <p><b>Vaccines include:</b> Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna</p>
    <p>Number of doses required: 2 doses, intramuscular</p>
    <p><b>What to know:</b> The COVID-19 RNA vaccine consists of mRNA molecules made in a lab that code for parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus – specifically the virus’ spike protein. Once injected into the body, the mRNA instructs the cells to produce antigens – such as the spike protein mentioned – which are then detected by immune cells, triggering a response by the body’s lymphocytes. The killer T-cells destroy the infected cells, while the B-cells and helper T-cells support antibody production. Whoever is exposed to the COVID-19 coronavirus in the future would have an immune system that recognizes it, and in turn fight off the infection.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>3. Non-Replicating Viral Vector</h3>
    <p><b>Vaccines include:</b> Oxford-AstraZeneca, Sputnik V (Gamaleya Research Institute)</p>
    <p>Number of doses required: 2 doses, intramuscular</p>
    <p><b>What to know:</b> This type of vaccine introduces a safe, modified version of the virus – known as “the vector” – to deliver genetic code for the antigen. In a COVID-19 vaccine, the “vector” is the spike proteins found on the surface of the coronavirus. Once the body’s cells are “infected”, the cells are instructed to produce a large amount of antigens, which in turn trigger an immune response.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>4. Protein Subunit</h3>
    <p><b>Vaccines include:</b> Novavax</p>
    <p>Number of doses required: 2 doses, intramuscular</p>
    <p><b>What to know:</b> The protein subunit vaccine contains purified “pieces” of a pathogen rather than the whole pathogen to trigger an immune response. It is thought that by restricting the immune system to the whole pathogen, the risk of side effects is minimized.</p>
