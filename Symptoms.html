    <h1 class="sub_head">Symptoms of COVID-19</h1>
    <p class="para">People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms.the most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty in breathing. Emergency symptoms include difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present. Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.</p>
    <h2 class="block">Some of the common symptoms are : </h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <h3 class="btn" onclick="hidden_1()">Fever</h3>
    <div id="hidden1" class="hid" style="display: none;">
        <p class="sub_block">Fever is one of the most common symptoms in COVID-19 patients. However, its absence at an initial screening does not rule out COVID-19. Fever in the first week of a COVID-19 infection is part of the body's natural immune response; however, if the infections develop into a cytokine storm the fever is counterproductive. As of September 2020, little research had focused on relating fever intensity to outcomes.</p>
    </div></li>
    <li>
    <h3 class="btn" onclick="hidden_2()">Muscle Pain</h3>
    <div id="hidden2" class="hid" style="display: none;">
        <p class="sub_block">A June 2020 systematic review reported a 27–35% prevalence of fatigue, 14–19% for muscle pain, 10–14% for sore throat. As of July 2020, the ECDC reported a prevalence rate of ~63% for muscle weakness (asthenia), ~63% for muscle pain (myalgia), and ~53% for sore throat.</p>
    </div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3 class="btn" onclick="hidden_3()">Cough</h3>
    <div id="hidden3" class="hid" style="display: none;">
        <p class="sub_block ">Cough is another typical symptom of COVID-19, which could be either dry or a productive cough. 59% of people who were positive from covid had the problem of cough.</p>
    </div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3 class="btn" onclick="hidden_4()">Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</h3>
    <div id="hidden4" class="hid" style="display: none;">
        <p class="sub_block">Some symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, are more common in patients who need hospital care. Shortness of breath tends to develop later in the illness.Known clinically as dyspnea, shortness of breath is one of the hallmark symptoms of COVID-19, the disease that’s caused by the new coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2.Unlike many other conditions that can cause shortness of breath, this symptom can persist and quickly escalate in people with COVID-19.</p>
    </div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3 class="btn" onclick="hidden_5()">Headache and Fatigue</h3>
    <div id="hidden5" class="hid" style="display: none;">
        <p class="sub_block">A headache can also be a symptom of COVID-19 in people with migraine. In these cases, headaches have been reported as occurring prior to the onset of more typical COVID-19 symptoms, like fever and cough.A WHO report that looked at over 55,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 found that a headache was reported in 13.6 percentTrusted Source of these cases.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3 class="btn" onclick="hidden_6()">Lose of sense of smell</h3>
    <div id="hidden6" class="hid" style="display: none;">
        <p class="sub_block">In some people, COVID-19 causes people to temporarily lose their sense of smell.This symptom, if it is present at all, often appears early in the illness. Its onset is often reported to be sudden. Smell usually returns to normal within a month. However, for some patients it improves very slowly and is associated with odors being perceived as unpleasant or different than they originally did (parosmia), and for some people smell does not return for at least many months. It is an unusual symptom for other respiratory diseases, so it is used for symptom-based screening</p>
        <p class="sub_block">A June 2020 systematic review found a 29–54% prevalence of olfactory dysfunction for people with COVID-19, while an August 2020 study using a smell-identification test reported that 96% of people with COVID-19 had some olfactory dysfunction, and 18% had total smell loss. Another June 2020 systematic review reported a 4–55% prevalence of hyposmia. As of July 2020, the ECDC reported a prevalence rate of ~70% for loss of smell.</p>
    </div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3 class="btn" onclick="hidden_7()">Loss of taste</h3>
    <div id="hidden7" class="hid" style="display: none;">
        <p class="sub_block">In some people, COVID-19 causes people to temporarily experience changes in how food tastes (dysgeusia or ageusia). Changes to chemesthesis, which includes chemically triggered sensations such as spiciness, are also reported. As of January 2021, the mechanism for taste and chemesthesis symptoms were not well understood. A June 2020 systematic review found a 24–54% prevalence of gustatory dysfunction for people with COVID-19. Another June 2020 systematic review reported a 1–8% prevalence of hypogeusia. As of July 2020, the ECDC reported a prevalence rate of ~54% for gustatory dysfunction.</p>
    </div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3 class="btn" onclick="hidden_8()">Nausea or Vomitting</h3>
    <div id="hidden8" class="hid" style="display: none;">
        <p class="sub_block">Nausea or vomitting is not a common symptom.However,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), many people with COVID-19 experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea—sometimes even before developing the respiratory tract symptoms.In March, 22-year-old Amy Shircel from Madison, Wisconsin, began detailing her COVID-19 symptoms in a series of tweets. "I'm 22 and I tested positive for COVID-19. Take it from me - you do NOT want to catch this," she wrote. Shircel shared that the first few days of her illness were manageable, with a mild cough, headache, chills, and a runny nose. Because she had just visited Europe recently, her state allowed her to get tested for COVID-19 with minor symptoms. But things progressed on the third day. "I couldn't keep anything down. I was vomiting constantly. I couldn't sleep, I obviously couldn't eat," she wrote. The next day, she received a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. She detailed her symptoms through day 12 of her illness—after being hospitalized for dehydration—and still had "all the major symptoms" even then, but is apparently recovered now.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
    <h3 class="btn" onclick="hidden_9()">Diarrhea</h3>
    <div id="hidden9" class="hid" style="display: none;">
        <p class="sub_block">Some people with COVID-19 develop gastrointestinal symptoms either alone or with respiratory symptoms.Some patients with COVID-19 experience, particularly diarrhea, as the first sign of illness, according to a new study.Still, they note that digestive problems are common overall and don't necessarily mean that a person has COVID-19. But doctors should recognize that sudden digestive symptoms in people with a possible COVID-19 contact "should at least prompt consideration of the illness".</p>
    </div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3 class="btn" onclick="hidden_10()">Other neurological and psychiatric symptoms</h3>
    <div id="hidden10" class="hid" style="display: none;"> 
        <p class="sub_block">Other neurological symptoms appear to be rare, but may affect half of patients who are hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Some reported symptoms include delirium, stroke, brain hemorrhage, memory loss, psychosis, peripheral nerve damage, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Neurological symptoms in many cases are correlated with damage to the brain's blood supply or encephalitis, which can progress in some cases to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Strokes have been reported in younger people without conventional risk factors.As of September 2020, it was unclear whether these symptoms were due to direct infection of brain cells, or of overstimulation of the immune system. A June 2020 systematic review reported a 6–16% prevalence of vertigo or dizziness, 7–15% for confusion, and 0–2% for ataxia.</p>
    </div>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="block">Long term effects</h2>
    <p class="para">Some early studies suggest that ten to twenty percent of people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems, including fatigue and shortness of breath. About 5-10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.</p>
    <p class="para">By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID-19. The majority of CT scans performed show lung abnormalities in people tested after 28 days of illness. People with advanced age, severe disease, prolonged ICU stays, or who smoke are more likely to have long-lasting effects, including pulmonary fibrosis. Overall, approximately one-third of those investigated after four weeks will have findings of pulmonary fibrosis or reduced lung function as measured by DLCO, even in asymptomatic people, but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time.</p>
    <h2 class="block">Effect on pregnant women</h2>
    <p class="para">Generally, pregnant women do not appear to be riskier than healthy adults to develop a more serious disease or any complications if affected by a coronavirus. Mostly, they will only experience mild to moderate flu-like symptoms. If you are pregnant and your flu-like symptoms are getting worse, it could mean that your chest infection is getting more severe, and you may require hospitalization. If you develop more severe symptoms or your recovery is getting delayed, contact a first response hospital near you immediately.</p>
    <p class="para"><b>What effect will coronavirus have on baby if mother tests positive for COVID-19?</b><br> As this is a very new virus, all the information and evidence is still not available to us. There is no evidence to suggest an increased risk of miscarriage if exposed to COVID-19. There is also no evidence of vertical transmission, which refers to the ability of the virus to pass to your unborn baby during pregnancy. In a study of nine pregnant women in China who tested positive for COVID-19, all nine babiestested negative for the virus and were healthy overall. One pregnant lady in London tested positivefor coronavirus and later her newborn also tested positive. However, it is unclear whether the babycontracted the viral infection in utero or shortly after birth. Expert opinion is that the baby isunlikely to be exposed during pregnancy, and it is unlikely for the baby to have any defects indevelopment as a result. As of now, there isn’t any new evidence that says otherwise.</p>
    <h2 class="block">Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and COVID-19</h2>
    <p class="para">Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious condition that appears to be linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most children who become infected with the COVID-19 virus have only a mild illness. But in children who go on to develop MIS-C, some organs and tissues — such as the heart, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive system, brain, skin or eyes — become severely inflamed. Signs and symptoms depend on which areas of the body are affected.</p>
    <p class="para">Signs and symptoms of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) include those below, though not all children have the same symptoms: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fever that lasts 24 hours or longer</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
        <li>Pain in the stomach</li>
        <li>Skin rash</li>
        <li>Feeling unusually tired</li>
        <li>Fast heartbeat</li>
        <li>Rapid breathing</li>
        <li>Red eyes</li>
        <li>Redness or swelling of the lips and tongue</li>
        <li>Redness or swelling of the hands or feet</li>
        <li> Headache, dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
        <li>Enlarged lymph nodes</li>
